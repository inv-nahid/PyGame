Hand-Tracking Game
Overview
Hand-Tracking Game is an interactive Python application that uses computer vision to track hand gestures in real-time, allowing players to interact with on-screen targets using their index finger. Built with MediaPipe and OpenCV, this game combines gesture recognition with engaging mechanics like scoring and enemy movement.
Features

Real-Time Hand Tracking: Uses MediaPipe Hands to detect and track hand landmarks with high accuracy.
Gesture Interaction: Players use their index finger to hit randomly placed targets on the screen.
Scoring System: Tracks and displays the playerâ€™s score as they hit targets.
Dynamic Enemies: Targets (enemies) appear at random positions after each hit.
Visual Feedback: Displays hand landmarks and targets using OpenCV for an intuitive experience.

Tech Stack

Python: Core programming language for game logic.
MediaPipe: For hand landmark detection and tracking.
OpenCV: For video capture, processing, and rendering.
NumPy: For numerical computations and coordinate handling.

Prerequisites

Python (v3.8+): For running the application.
Pip: Package manager for installing dependencies.
Webcam: Required for capturing video input.
Git: For version control (optional).

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-tracking-game.git
cd hand-tracking-game

2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip:
pip install mediapipe opencv-python numpy

3. Run the Game
Execute the main script to start the game:
python hand_tracking_game.py


Ensure your webcam is connected and working.
A window will open displaying the game interface.

Usage

Start the Game: Run the script, and the webcam will activate, showing a live video feed.
Play: Move your hand in front of the webcam. Use your index finger to "hit" the green circle (enemy) on the screen.
Score Points: Each successful hit increases your score, displayed in the top-right corner.
Exit: Press the q key to quit the game and close the window.

Game Mechanics

A green circle (enemy) appears at a random position on the screen.
Use your index finger to touch the enemy circle, detected via hand tracking.
Upon a hit, the score increments, and a new enemy appears at a random location.
The game continues until you press q to exit.

Future Improvements

Difficulty Levels: Add varying difficulty by adjusting enemy size and spawn rate.
Multiple Gestures: Support additional gestures (e.g., fist, open palm) for different actions.
UI Enhancements: Improve the interface with better graphics and sound effects.
Multiplayer Mode: Enable two-player mode using dual-hand tracking.
